# Introduction
The Art Gallery project is an initiative founded in 2023 with the message "Be Yourself, Love Yourself." Its aim is to create a space for exploring and experiencing diverse works of art. The Art Gallery provides a platform for artists and art enthusiasts to showcase and share their creations with the community.

The Art Gallery project goes beyond displaying artworks; it also organizes activities and events related to art, such as exhibitions, workshops, and art courses. It is a destination for art lovers who want to learn and discover more about different art forms.

The Art Gallery aspires to become a popular and notable art destination, where people can find inspiration and nurture their creativity.

# Techniques
- IDE: VS Code and XAMPP
- Language: Frontend: html(HyperText Markup Language ),js(JavaScript),ejs(Embedded JavaScript templating) and css(Cascading Style Sheets); Backend:Java
- Framework: In our project, we are using framework Vue.js((https://vuejs.org/) to define for frontend
- Library: In other to control our database, we have used SQLite(https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and Xampp(https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to define Backend more easier

# Challenges
- Learn how to get acquainted with github
- Learn how to get used to new frameworks
- Encountered many errors during the coding process

# Acknowledgments
- Here are a few websites we consulted to complete our project:
  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk">Git,Github tutorial</a>
  - <a href="https://bulldogjob.com/readme/how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project">Readme tutorial</a>
- And especially, it is indispensable for the knowledge that Mrs.Loan taught last semester. Once again, many thanks to you, Mrs.Loan for guiding us
